## Design

### Colour Scheme
RGB
 ![](readme/colour-palette.png)
 * I wanted the site to be bright and have bursts of colour throughout.
 * I used colour space to create a neighbour palette involving two main colours, blue and purple. I used them throught out the site and kept the colour palette in theme with the quiz type themselves. 
 
### Typography
 * Darker Grotesque
 * Roboto

### Imagery

* Images used on the site were all sourced from ![Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) 
* Striking imagery was used on the site to catch the users eye.
* An image of penguins is seen on first glance, successfully telling the user what the quiz is about through the image alone. Similarly, the photo for the Harry Potter quiz displays a photo of the castle and a sign for 'hogwarts'.
* Background imagery is used for both quizzes. The images used further display the theme of the quiz, allowing the user to fully immerse in the quiz without another distraction in the background.


### Site Layout

* The site consists of a main home page which displays 'this weeks' and 'last weeks' quiz to the user. Once the quiz is clicked, a new window will apppear displaying the corresponding quiz.
